## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. PowerShell with elevated privileges (Run as Administrator).
2. Active internet connection to download required packages and tools.
3. Ensure execution policies allow the script to run. You can set this with: `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`.

### Installation Steps

1. There are multiple ways to execute the setup script:

   a. **Directly from the Web**:
   
      Execute the following command in an elevated PowerShell window:

      Method 1 - Using net.webclient for downloading and executing
            ```powershell
      iex (new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite/master/AdminLaunchOption.ps1')
      ```
      
      Method 2 - Using Invoke-WebRequest with its alias iwr 
      ```powershell
      iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite/master/AdminLaunchOption.ps1 | iex
      ```
      
      Method 3 - Using Invoke-RestMethod with its alias irm 
      ```powershell
      irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite/master/AdminLaunchOption.ps1 | iex
      ```

   b. **Local Execution**:
   
      - Download the provided PowerShell script (`NexTool-Setup.ps1`).
      - Right-click on the downloaded file and choose "Run with PowerShell".

3. The script will automatically handle the setup:
   - It checks and installs Chocolatey if not present.
   - Installs or updates essential tools like `aria2`, `wget`, `curl`, and `powershell-core`.
   - Ensures Python is installed and sets up required Python packages.
   - Downloads and sets up Winget if not present.
   - Downloads the NexTool Python script and prepares it for execution.

4. After the script execution completes, it will launch the `NexTool.py` Python script.

**Note**: The script creates temporary directories (`C:\NexTool` & `C:\PS`) during its operation, which will be cleared out once the setup is complete.

For users who prefer an executable, a `PS2EXE` version of the script is available in the [Releases](https://github.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite/releases) section of our GitHub repository.

For issues during installation, refer to the "Feedback & Issues" section and report any problems you encounter.

# Closing Remarks

The NexTool Windows Suite aims to be the comprehensive toolbox for Windows users, building on the foundational work done in [AIO](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO). The previous version of the application was archived, as there were aspects that felt too routine and monotonous, including the layout and the version numbering approach.

With the insights gained from [AIO](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO), this project intends to craft an "All-Purpose" toolbox that's both intuitive and user-friendly. Using Python for the GUI allows for a more dynamic and responsive interface, catering to the diverse needs of Windows users.
