# Closing Remarks

The NexTool Windows Suite aims to be the comprehensive toolbox for Windows users, building on the foundational work done in [AIO](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO). The previous version of the application was archived, as there were aspects that felt too routine and monotonous, including the layout and the version numbering approach.

With the insights gained from [AIO](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO), this project intends to craft an "All-Purpose" toolbox that's both intuitive and user-friendly. Using Python for the GUI allows for a more dynamic and responsive interface, catering to the diverse needs of Windows users.
